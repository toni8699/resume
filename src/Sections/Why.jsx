                    In Fall 2020, as the world shifted online, I returned to Vietnam, uncertain of what the future held. When in-person classes resumed in 2021, I stayed behind—travel restrictions made leaving difficult, but more than that, I felt the weight of family, of home, of a life pulling me in a different direction.
                    In the years that followed, I drifted from math and science, searching for meaning elsewhere—restoring pianos, teaching music, journeying to remote villages to share languages. And somewhere in that search, I found clarity. In 2024, with a heart full of purpose, I was given the chance to return, ready to begin again.
